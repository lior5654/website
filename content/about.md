## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher, based in northern Israel.

I am an [IOI Bronze Medalist](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/7485), currently studying @ [The Open University of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University_of_Israel) as a Mathematics major. Used to do [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) for a while, peaking at 2065 ELO rating.

I play [CTF (Capture The Flag)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) competitions with team [Projet Sekai](https://sekai.team/), rated 4th globally as of April 2023.

## About This Site

My goal is to post writeups of interesting problems I solve or/and concepts I encounter, related to security, mathematics and/or algorithms.

I will try to cover a variety of topics, such as Cryptography, Data Structures & Algortihms, Reverse Engineering and more!
